/**
 * Your body, on file — the personal inputs the mentor ASKS for.
 *
 * The mentor (Claude Code) interviews you — height, weight, age, units — the
 * first time a goal or tile needs body math (peak pharmacokinetics scale by
 * bodyweight; fuel targets scale by all of it). It writes the answers here,
 * you reload. Never guessed, never required up front: every field is optional
 * and the math degrades gracefully to sensible defaults.
 *
 * Two write paths, same as goals/weights:
 *   · this file (DEFAULT_PROFILE) — the mentor edits it in VS Code
 *   · localStorage 'vitality:profile' — the connector or a UI can retune
 *     without a code change; it wins over the defaults
 *
 * Ask in their units, store metric. lib knows only cm/kg.
